            <h2>Why San Francisco</h2>
            <div class="separator-sm center"></div>
            <h4>San Francisco is the perfect place to develop an innovative framework for deploying cutting edge technology.</h4>  

            <h4>As a geographically dense city, innovation spreads quickly helped by a nimble government and a culture of openness.  We have the know how and inquisitive spirit to not only effectively design the transportation system of the future but also to spread it.</h4>

            <h4>San Francisco has already cultivated innovative transportation options that are changing the way the country and world move.  Our public transit system is one of the best in the country, with over 700,000 daily boardings.  We have pioneered the use of “red carpet” transit-only lanes to decrease travel times for Muni riders.  The SFpark pilot used dynamic pricing to cut time spent looking for parking nearly in half and decreased greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent.</h4>

            <h4>Just like our leading public transit system, San Francisco is leading the way with shared transportation services. Our history is distinguished by shared mobility options like:</h4>

            <h4><ul>
            <li>Shared vehicles, like City Carshare and Scoot.</li>
            <li>Microtransit or pooling like Chariot or Carma</li>
            <li>Ridesharing vehicles like Lyft, Uber and Shuddle</li>
            </ul></h4>

            <h4>Our experience with a diverse set of shared transportation services shows that San Franciscans will try and embrace new services that fill market needs.</h4>

            <h4>San Francisco is a world-wide leader in innovation. The San Francisco Bay Area is</h4>
             
            <h4>
            <ul>
            <li>The number one global start-up ecosystem.</li>
            <li>The number one city in venture capital investment.</li>
            <li>Has more electric vehicles than any other city.</li>
            <li>Has the second most electric vehicle charging stations per capita in the US.</li>
            <li>Has 10 companies currently testing automated vehicles.</li>
            </ul></h4>  
             
            <h4>Furthermore, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency has a first of its kind Equity Strategy to ensure that transportation is accessible affordable to all of our citizens.  This framework will harness the innovative culture of San Francisco to make sure that everyday people benefit from the work we do building the transportation system of the future.</h4>
